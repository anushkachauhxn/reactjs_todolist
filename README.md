# To-Do List App
This is a simple app that lets you: 
* add
* edit 
* delete 
items on your to do list. 

I am a beginner in React JS and this project helped me gain more practice and experience.

### Future Plans:
I hope to add more featues in the future.
For example: 
* ability to rearrange items by dragging them
* changing colours of different items
* labelling them according to type of task
* finding items in their respective 'label' folders
